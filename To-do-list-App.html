        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          To- do list is a app, developed  with  JavaScript and jQuery  that  loads  data  from  an  external  API  and  enables  the  viewing  of  data  points  in  detail. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In this app the user should be able to add a new item to a list of items. The user can also be able to cross out an item from the list of items. The user can delete an item from the list of items.
        The user can change the order of items in the list of items. 
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose & Objective</h2>
        <p>
          I built this personal project in the context of a CareerFoundry course
          to master HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive and engaging web
          app to provide movers with inspiration and details about a variety of
          movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenge was to build an API from scratch, set up and connect a
          database, as well as make use of the most popular frontend JavaScript
          libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time the project was set up to produce a great portfolio
          project and get used to common project requirements like user stories
          and user flows.

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>
          All in all it took approximately 5 days. For sure a lot more than a
          project like this should take in “real life”. But since it was a study
          projects, there were so many things to learn and figure out. I got
          really absorbed in it an at the end felt ready to call myself a frontend web
          developer.

        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>
          Big thanks goes to my tutor Ahmed Mahfoudh. Without him this would
          have been way less instructive and fun. And of course I also thank my
          mentor Stephen Barungi. Thanks also to Marion Sénéchal for great
          feedback on this case study.

            <p>
              For the server side I created a RESTful API using Node.js and
              Express as well as a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API
              allows to retrieve data about the moves and users from the
              database through common HTTP requests and returns JSON. API and
              database are connected by the business logic layer, using
              Mongoose.

              <b>Authentication</b><br />
              I also implemented a login endpoint with basic HTTP authentication
              returning a authorization JWT (token) to the client. This is
              necessary to ensure only logged in users can access the database.
              Initially the mechanisms of authentication and authorization were
              quite challenging for me. But after some time and effort it became
              clear and functional.<br />
              To test the endpoints I used Postman.
            </p>

          <div class="txt-container">
            <p>
              Once the backend was set up, I created a frontend (the user
              interface) using React library. It is a single-page, responsive
              web application (SPA), built following the MVC design pattern.
              There are multiple views: Registration, login, main view (where
              all the moves are shown as cards), move view (where details about
              a specific move are elaborated), style view and source view
              (details about the style/source, as well as all the matching moves
              in the database) and a profile view (here the user can edit their
              user data and view cards for their favorite moves).

          <b>Starting with React</b><br />
          This was the biggest and most challenging, but also very exciting part
          for me as there was a lot to learn starting off with React. Compared
          to pure/classical HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is a very different
          approach to interface creation and design. There were many topics I
          had to research, experiment with and figure out.
        </p> -->
      <div class="section">
        <!-- <h2>Conclusion</h2> -->
        <br/>
        <p>
         To do list was my first JavaScript and Jquery Project. Traversing from the
          HTML, CSS to all the way to two great user interfaces was an amazing achievement.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          The whole server side, with it’s security mechanisms and logic layers
          was quite challenging at first. But after a lot of research and some
          help from my tutor it all made sense.

          <br/> <br/> -->
          
          I am quite proud of the product I produced. I would like to continue working
          on this project for some more time to improve the product.
